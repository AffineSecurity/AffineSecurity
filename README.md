### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Sam

I specialize in offensive security, specifically red/purple teaming. I'm interested in learning about all things adversiarial: from tradecraft, to infrastructure, to tool development, to techniques. 

I also like to talk (a lot), and I've given a few security-focused talks at some cons before. You can check them out here:

I also have a blog. I haven't had much time to post recently, but whenever I feel I've got something new and exciting to share I'll probably write about it there. You can find it at https://affinesecurity.gitlab.io/.

As you can see from my blog, I tend to use GitLab a bit more than GitHub and have a few personal projects saved over there. Feel free to check them out [here](https://gitlab.com/AffineSecurity).
